1. DA is 0, everything is 0
2. user adds income, DA recalculates
3. User adds expenses, DA recalculates
4. User adds daily purchases, subtracts from DA
	- if purchase is more than DA, set DA to 0
	- have option to recalculate?
5. if the day is not matching on the DA, recalculate it

Add Features
-------------------------------------------------
[X?] Enforce correct maths:
	- have daily amounts updated correctly when deleting, editing
	- currently editing a transaction recalculates DA instead of just subtracting the correct number

[X]Pagination for transactions
	-https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-ix-pagination

[X]Add edit button and edit page to transactions
	-add html button in _transactions.html to send to /edit page with a next? args
	-add an extra <th> object in user.html
	-add /edit page in routes, user is current user and addtransaction form is the form
	-add edit.html using addtransactionform with a submit link

[X?]Enforce $AB.CD formatting for DA, transaction amounts
	-formatting restricted to AB.CD
	-although AB.00 formats to AB, likely not an issue

[]Add ability to rollover recurring transactions after month is over
	- upon logging in/going to index page - check month of DA versus current month
		>if they don't match,
			-ditch the non-recurring transactions(or move to previous month table?)
			-change the recurring transactions to move up a month
			-if the day is invalid move it to the latest day on the month
			-recalculate DA
