1. DA is 0, everything is 0
2. user adds income, DA recalculates
3. User adds expenses, DA recalculates
4. User adds daily purchases, subtracts from DA
	- if purchase is more than DA, set DA to 0
	- have option to recalculate?
5. if the day is not matching on the DA, recalculate it

	-pygal http://pygal.org/en/stable/documentation/index.html


[]Add ability to rollover recurring transactions after month is over
	- Also repeating frequency selection

		>if they don't match,
			-ditch the non-recurring transactions(or move to previous month table?)
			-change the recurring transactions to move up a month
			-if the day is invalid move it to the latest day on the month
			-recalculate DA
	
[]Add a first time budget setup script

[]Put a dashboard on index page with stats


[X]Add separate page(results?) that shows 2 tables, one with recurring and one with nonrecurring transactions
